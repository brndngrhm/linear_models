####1.

a) Since this is a randomized complete block design, we know that are at least 6 experimental units with each block. This design structure ensures that, at a minimum, a complete set of treatments can be assigned to experimental units in each block. This leads to 2 scenarios: block size = 6, or block size > 6. 

    If the block size = 6, then we will have exactly 1 treatment per experimental unit per block. Randomizing the treatments in this case can be accomplished using a random number generator to generate 10 sets of 6 random numbers between 1 and 6. I did some research and came across a website called [randomizer.org](https://www.randomizer.org/) where this type of randomization can be easily accomplished. Assigning the treatments randomly is importsnt as it works towards ensuring the treatments were applied in a way that minimizes any bias.
    
    If the block size > 6 (i.e. more expermental units per block than number of treatments), some treatments would be applied more than once. If this were the case I would try to balance which treatments appeared in each block as best as I could, so that a given block would not have more of one treatment than any other. It could be inevitable that some blocks receive more of a certain treatment than the others, so after assigning a complete set of treatments per block I would try to randomize the remaining treatment assignments among the blocks. This would be more difficult as the size of the block size increased.
