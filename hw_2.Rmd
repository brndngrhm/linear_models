a) Since this is a randomized complete block design, we know that are at least 6 experimental units with each block. This design structure ensures that, at a minimum, a complete set of treatments can be assigned to experimental units in each block. This leads to 2 scenarios: block size = 6, or block size > 6. 

    If the block size = 6, then we will have exactly 1 treatment per experimental unit per block. Randomizing the treatments in this case can be accomplished using a random number generator to generate 10 sets of 6 random numbers between 1 and 6. I did some research and came across a website called [randomizer.org](https://www.randomizer.org/) where this randomization scheme can be easily accomplished.
    
    If the block size > 6, some treatments would need to be applied to more than once.
