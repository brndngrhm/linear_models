####1.

a) Since this is a randomized complete block design, we know that are at least 6 experimental units with each block. This design structure ensures that, at a minimum, a complete set of treatments can be assigned to experimental units in each block. Since the block size = 6,  we will have exactly 1 treatment per experimental unit per block. Randomizing the treatments in this case can be accomplished using a random number generator to generate 10 sets of 6 random numbers between 1 and 6. I did some research and came across a website called [randomizer.org](https://www.randomizer.org/) where this type of randomization can be easily accomplished. Assigning the treatments randomly is important as it works towards ensuring the treatments were applied in a way that minimizes any bias.

using the website above I came up with the following design:

.              | Treatment  |  Treatment |   Treatment |  Treatment |  Treatment   |  Treatment   | 
------------- | -------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
Block 1       | 6 | 3 | 2 | 4| 5 | 1 |
Block 2       | 4 | 5 | 2 | 1| 6 | 3 |
Block 3       |  1 | 3 | 4 | 2| 6 | 5 |
Block 4       | 2 | 3 | 5 | 6| 4 | 1 |
Block 5       |  1 | 4 | 2 | 6 | 3 | 5 |
Block 6       | 6 | 5 | 3 | 1| 4 | 2 |
Block 7       | 4 | 2 | 3 | 1| 5 | 6 |
Block 8       |  4 | 5 | 6 |  2 | 3 | 1 |
Block 9       | 2 | 6 | 1 | 4| 3 | 5 |
Block 10      |  1 | 5 | 2 | 4| 3 | 6 |


b) To determine how many different randomization schemes are possible we can count combinations of 10 choose 6, which is 10!/(6! (10 - 6)!) = 210. There are 210 different ways to arrange the 6 treatments among the 10 blocks.

a) Some questions I would have for the investigator are:
    1. What question are you trying to answer with this data?
    2. How was the data collected?
    3. Was it all collected at once or spread out over time? If so how much time was there between collections?
    4.
